    "### Project Background\n",
    "Understanding student self-study habits is crucial for optimizing learning outcomes. This project analyzes data collected through student surveys to gain insights into their study patterns and identify potential areas for improvement.\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "This project aims to achieve the following objectives through a detailed analysis of student self-reported data:\n",
    "- Determine the average study duration for students. \n",
    "- Calculate the average Rate of Perceived Exhaustion (RPE) experienced by students during self-study. By measuring RPE, the project aims to assess the mental and physical effort invested by students during their study sessions.\n",
    "- Identify prime study times based on duration and RPE levels. This objective involves analyzing the relationship between study time slots and both duration and RPE to determine when students are most engaged and productive.\n",
    "- Investigate the relationship between subject, duration, and RPE. This analysis aims to uncover whether specific subjects demand longer study hours or lead to higher levels of perceived exertion, offering insights into subject-specific study strategies.\\\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Scope of the Study\n",
    "This study is focused on analyzing self-reported data collected from a sample of students through a structured survey. The data encompasses information on the subject studied, the start and end times of study sessions, and the Rate of Perceived Exhaustion (RPE). The scope of the study is limited to exploring the relationships between these variables, and the findings may not be generalizable to all student populations due to the limited sample size and potential biases in self-reported data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "This project is guided by the following research questions:\n",
    "- How much time do students dedicate to self-study on average? This question aims to quantify the average duration of self-study sessions for female students, providing a basic understanding of their time allocation.\n",
    "- What is the average RPE reported by students during self-study sessions? This question seeks to understand the general level of perceived exertion experienced by students while studying independently.\n",
    "- Are there specific time slots when students study for longer durations or experience lower RPE? This question explores the concept of prime study times, aiming to identify periods when students are most effective in their self-study efforts.\n",
    "- Does the choice of subject influence study duration or RPE? This question investigates the potential impact of different subjects on study habits, seeking to understand whether certain subjects require more time or induce higher levels of perceived exertion.\n",

    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "This section outlines the methodology employed in this project to analyze student self-study behaviors. The approach involves utilizing Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization, guided by the research questions established in the introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project was collected through a structured survey administered to a sample of students. The survey included questions about:\n",
    "- The subject studied during each self-study session\n",
    "- The start and end times of each session\n",
    "- The student's perceived level of exhaustion, measured using the Rate of Perceived Exhaustion (RPE) scale. 1 denoting least and 5 denoting maximum.\n",
    "- This scale is commonly used in exercise science to measure subjective feelings of exertion during physical activity, and it can also be applied to assess mental effort during cognitive tasks like studying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "After data collection, the survey responses were compiled into a comma-separated value (CSV) file named 'timeSheet.csv'. This file was then imported into a Python environment using the pandas library for data analysis and manipulation. The raw data underwent several preprocessing steps to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.\n",
    "Key preprocessing steps included:\n",
    "- Removing Irrelevant Columns: Columns containing irrelevant information, such as 'Date' and 'Email Address', were dropped from the dataset using the `df.drop()` function in `pandas`.\n",
    "- Extracting Date and Time: The 'Timestamp' column, which contained both date and time information, was processed using the `pd.to_datetime()` function to extract separate 'dates' and 'time' columns. The original 'Timestamp' column was then dropped from the dataset.\n",
    "The 'Timestamp' column, containing both date and time information, is converted to datetime objects using the `pd.to_datetime()` function. This allows for separate extraction of 'dates' and 'time' using the `dt.date` and `dt.time` attributes.<br>\n",
    "`df['Timestamp'] = df['Timestamp'].apply(lambda x : pd.to_datetime(str(x)))`<br>\n",
    "`df['dates'] = df['Timestamp'].dt.date`<br>\n",
    "`df['time'] = df['Timestamp'].dt.time`<br>\n",
    "- Calculating Duration: To determine the duration of each study session, the 'Start Time' and 'End Time' columns were converted to datetime objects using `pd.to_datetime()`. The duration of each session was then calculated by subtracting the 'Start Time' from the 'End Time' and stored in a new 'Duration' column.\n",
    "The 'Start Time' and 'End Time' columns are transformed into datetime objects using `pd.to_datetime()`. The 'Duration' is then calculated by subtracting 'Start Time' from 'End Time'.<br>\n",
    "`df['Start Time'] = df['Start Time'].apply(lambda x : pd.to_datetime(str(x)))`<br>\n",
    "`df['End Time'] = df['End Time'].apply(lambda x : pd.to_datetime(str(x)))`<br>\n",
    "`df['Duration'] = df['End Time'] - df['Start Time']`<br>\n",
    "- Converting Duration to Readable Format: Initially, the 'Duration' column is in a format that includes \"`0 days`\" followed by the actual duration in hours, minutes, and seconds (e.g., \"`0 days 01:30:00`\"). This code aims to remove the \"`0 days`\" prefix and retain only the time portion for better readability.The code snippet used for converting the 'Duration' column to a more readable format is:<br>\n",
    "`df['Duration'] = df['Duration'].astype(str).str.split('0 days ').str[-1]`<br>\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of the code:<br>\n",
    "`df['Duration'].astype(str)`: This converts the 'Duration' column to string data type, allowing string operations to be applied.<br>\n",
    "`.str.split('0 days ')`: This splits each string in the 'Duration' column at the \"0 days \" delimiter, resulting in a list of strings for each row.<br>\n",
    "`.str[-1]`: This selects the last element from the list of strings generated by the split operation. As the duration time is the last part after the split, this effectively extracts the desired time portion.<br>\n",
    "By applying this code, the 'Duration' column will be transformed to contain only the time part of the duration, making it easier to read and work with in subsequent analyses. For instance, \"0 days 01:30:00\" would become \"01:30:00\".\n"

    "### 3.3 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "The preprocessed data was then subjected to EDA using a combination of pandas and matplotlib, a Python plotting library. EDA techniques were employed to:\n",
    "- Calculate Descriptive Statistics: The `df.describe()` function in pandas was used to obtain descriptive statistics for the 'RPE' column, such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. This provided an initial overview of the distribution of perceived exertion levels.\n",
    "- Grouping and Aggregation: The data was grouped by different variables, such as 'Name' and 'Subject', using the `groupby()` function in pandas. Aggregation functions like `mean()` were then applied to calculate average RPE and duration for each group.\n",
    "- Data Visualization: Bar plots were generated using matplotlib to visualize the average RPE and duration for different groups, including by student name, by subject, and by time of day. These visualizations helped identify patterns and trends in the data.\n"

I have assumed max duration to be reached as 3 hrs and max RPE 5. Here duration is mentioned in hrs. Hence the transparent one shows the max and foreground shows the actual values. \n"

    "This project delves into analyzing student study patterns using a dataset containing information about study subjects, durations, and perceived exertion levels (RPE). Through a series of data manipulations and visualizations, the project successfully uncovers key insights into the distinct study habits and preferences of three students: Nupur, Swara, and Jui. \n",

    "*   **Individualized Study Habits:** Each student exhibits unique study patterns. **Swara emerges as the most dedicated student in terms of time invested**, with the highest average study duration across subjects. **Jui, while spending slightly less time, consistently reports higher RPE scores**, suggesting she perceives the subjects as more demanding. **Nupur, on the other hand, shows a more balanced approach**, with her study durations and RPE levels varying significantly across subjects and times of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Prime Time Variability:**  Analyzing study durations and RPE across different times of day reveals the importance of **personalized study scheduling**.  **Nupur's prime study time appears to be the evening**, as evidenced by her longer durations and moderate RPE during this period.  **Jui's study pattern is relatively consistent across timeslots**,  while **Swara demonstrates a preference for mornings and dawn**,  despite experiencing higher RPE in the very early hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Subject-Specific Insights:** The analysis reveals **strong subject preferences** influencing study patterns. **Swara's significant time investment in Maths-I points toward a particular interest or focus on this subject.** **Nupur's preference for English**,  marked by longer durations and lower RPE,  suggests a potential strength in this area.  **Jui's focused dedication to Chemistry, evident through a high number of sessions, hints at a strategic approach to mastering the subject.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Session-Level Analysis:** **Analyzing session durations and RPE together provides a nuanced understanding of student productivity and focus.**  Some students engage in short, intense sessions, while others prefer longer, more relaxed periods. **The combination of duration and RPE reveals valuable insights into sessions where students thrive versus those where they might struggle**, helping to identify potential areas for improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these key conclusions, the project effectively demonstrates the value of data-driven insights in understanding student study habits. **The visualizations and analyses serve as powerful tools for educators and students to develop tailored study plans that optimize learning effectiveness, time management, and overall academic performance.** By leveraging these insights, students can identify their prime study times, adjust study strategies based on subject-specific challenges, and improve their overall learning experience. \n"
